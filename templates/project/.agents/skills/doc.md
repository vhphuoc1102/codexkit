# Codex Skills

> Guide to creating and using skills in this CodexKit repository

---

## 📋 Overview

General-purpose coding models do not know your project-specific context or team standards by default. Loading every rule or tool into the agent context causes bloat, latency, and noisy behavior.

**Codex skills** solve this through progressive disclosure. A skill is a package of specialized knowledge that stays dormant until the task matches the skill description.

## 📁 Structure and Scope

Skills are folder-based packages. You can define these scopes based on your needs:

| Scope         | Path                              | Description                          |
| ------------- | --------------------------------- | ------------------------------------ |
| **Workspace** | `<workspace-root>/skills/` | Available only in a specific project in this repository |

### Skill Directory Structure

```
my-skill/
├── SKILL.md      # (Required) Metadata & instructions
├── scripts/      # (Optional) Python or Bash scripts
├── references/   # (Optional) Text, documentation, templates
└── assets/       # (Optional) Images or logos
```

## 🔍 Example 1: Code Review Skill

This is an instruction-only skill; you only need to create the `SKILL.md` file.

### Step 1: Create the directory

```bash
mkdir -p skills/code-review
```

### Step 2: Create SKILL.md

```markdown
---
name: code-review
description: Reviews code changes for bugs, style issues, and best practices. Use when reviewing PRs or checking code quality.
---

# Code Review Skill

When reviewing code, follow these steps:

## Review checklist

1. **Correctness**: Does the code do what it's supposed to?
2. **Edge cases**: Are error conditions handled?
3. **Style**: Does it follow project conventions?
4. **Performance**: Are there obvious inefficiencies?

## How to provide feedback

- Be specific about what needs to change
- Explain why, not just what
- Suggest alternatives when possible
```

> **Note**: The `SKILL.md` file contains metadata (name, description) at the top, followed by the instructions. The agent will only read the metadata and load the full instructions only when needed.

### Try it out

Create a file `demo_bad_code.py`:

```python
import time

def get_user_data(users, id):
    # Find user by ID
    for u in users:
        if u['id'] == id:
            return u
    return None

def process_payments(items):
    total = 0
    for i in items:
        # Calculate tax
        tax = i['price'] * 0.1
        total = total + i['price'] + tax
        time.sleep(0.1)  # Simulate slow network call
    return total

def run_batch():
    users = [{'id': 1, 'name': 'Alice'}, {'id': 2, 'name': 'Bob'}]
    items = [{'price': 10}, {'price': 20}, {'price': 100}]

    u = get_user_data(users, 3)
    print("User found: " + u['name'])  # Will crash if None

    print("Total: " + str(process_payments(items)))

if __name__ == "__main__":
    run_batch()
```

**Prompt**: `review the @demo_bad_code.py file`

The Agent will automatically identify the `code-review` skill, load the information, and follow the instructions.

## 📄 Example 2: License Header Skill

This skill uses a reference file in the `resources/` (or `references/`) directory.

### Step 1: Create the directory

```bash
mkdir -p skills/license-header-adder/resources
```

### Step 2: Create the template file

**`skills/license-header-adder/resources/HEADER.txt`**:

```
/*
 * Copyright (c) 2026 YOUR_COMPANY_NAME LLC.
 * All rights reserved.
 * This code is proprietary and confidential.
 */
```

### Step 3: Create SKILL.md

**`skills/license-header-adder/SKILL.md`**:

```markdown
---
name: license-header-adder
description: Adds the standard corporate license header to new source files.
---

# License Header Adder

This skill ensures that all new source files have the correct copyright header.

## Instructions

1. **Read the Template**: Read the content of `resources/HEADER.txt`.
2. **Apply to File**: When creating a new file, prepend this exact content.
3. **Adapt Syntax**:
   - For C-style languages (Java, TS), keep the `/* */` block.
   - For Python/Shell, convert to `#` comments.
```

### Try it out

**Prompt**: `Create a new Python script named data_processor.py that prints 'Hello World'.`

The Agent will read the template, convert the comments to Python style, and automatically add it to the top of the file.

## 🎯 Conclusion

By creating skills, you turn a general AI model into something much closer to a project-specific teammate:

- ✅ Systematize best practices
- ✅ Adhere to code review rules
- ✅ Automatically add license headers
- ✅ The agent can follow your team conventions more reliably

Instead of repeating the same instructions every session, you encode them once in skills and let Codex apply them when relevant.
