# CodexKit Architecture

This document describes the project-level structure installed by CodexKit and how the main pieces work together.

## Overview

The scaffold is built around five layers:

- `AGENTS.md` as the routing and operating contract
- `.agents/skills/` for reusable capability modules
- `.agents/workflows/` for task playbooks
- `.codex/agents/` for focused subagents
- Beads (`br`/`bv`) as the dependency-aware work tracker when the project uses planned work items

Some projects may also include `.agents/.shared/` for reusable script-and-data packages that support multiple workflows.

The goal is to keep the system small, composable, and explicit. Skills provide knowledge, workflows provide process, subagents provide bounded execution roles, and Beads provide durable work state.

## Responsibilities

### AGENTS.md

`AGENTS.md` is the main control document. It defines:

- request classification
- routing from task type to workflow
- routing from workflow to subagent or skill
- validation expectations
- approval boundaries for risky execution
- Beads usage and close-approval expectations

This is the first file Codex should consult when deciding how to approach work in the repository.

### Skills

Skills live in `.agents/skills/<name>/SKILL.md`.

Each skill should stay narrow and reusable. A skill may optionally include:

- `agents/openai.yaml` for invocation policy and explicit agent behavior
- task-specific companion files such as `verify.md`, `handoff.md`, and rollout checklists
- `references/` for templates, examples, or detailed guidance
- `scripts/` for optional helpers
- `assets/` for support files

Skills are knowledge modules. They should not act like hidden automation.

### Workflows

Workflows live in `.agents/workflows/*.md`.

They define repeatable playbooks for common task types such as:

- brainstorming
- setup and onboarding
- challenging and stress-testing plans
- planning and creating Beads
- executing normal work or one assigned Bead
- enhancing
- debugging
- reviewing
- testing
- UI and UX design
- checking
- verifying
- deploying
- previewing
- status reporting
- swarming across multiple ready Beads
- shipping

Workflows should encode process, not domain knowledge.

### Beads

CodexKit treats Beads as the default issue tracker for scaffolded projects that need durable work items.

- `plan.md` creates PRD, epic, feature, task, bug, docs, or question Beads with `br create`.
- `execute.md` executes one assigned Bead or normal non-Bead implementation work.
- `swarm.md` selects ready Beads with `br ready` and `bv --robot-triage`, assigns one Bead per worker, then runs one aggregate `check.md` or `verify.md` pass.
- `br sync --flush-only` exports Beads state; it does not run git commands.
- Beads are not closed automatically. User approval is required before `br close`.

The local helper `.codex/codexkit_bead_state.mjs` tracks same-session execution state in `.codexkit/bead-state.json`: active, deferred, completed, failed, awaiting user close, review cycles, and swarm validation cycles.

### Shared Packages

Shared packages live in `.agents/.shared/`.

Use them when a workflow needs executable tooling or structured datasets that do not naturally belong to a single skill.

Impeccable is intentionally shipped as a skill at `.agents/skills/impeccable/`, not as a shared package, because it owns a full instruction contract, references, and helper scripts for UI/UX work. Its upstream attribution and Apache 2.0 license notes live in `.agents/skills/impeccable/NOTICE.md`.

### Subagents

Subagents live in `.codex/agents/*.toml`.

Each subagent should own a bounded role:

- `planner` for decomposition and sequencing
- `explorer` for repository mapping and codebase discovery
- `implementer` for small focused code changes
- `frontend_specialist` for UI and interaction work
- `backend_specialist` for server-side implementation
- `database_architect` for schema and migration design
- `mobile_developer` for mobile-specific work
- `debugger` for evidence gathering and root-cause isolation
- `performance_optimizer` for measured performance improvements
- `reviewer` for correctness and regression review
- `security_auditor` for threat-focused review
- `docs_researcher` for external API verification
- `documentation_writer` for technical guides and handoff docs
- `seo_specialist` for discoverability and content structure
- `devops_engineer` for CI, deploy, and operational changes
- `test_writer` for focused test additions

Subagents should be specialized enough that routing is predictable. Swarm workers receive one explicit Bead and the `execute.md` workflow; they do not choose their own Beads.

### MCP Configuration

Project-scoped MCP server definitions live in `.codex/config.toml` under `[mcp_servers]`.

Use this layer for external tool servers and remote context providers. Keep checked-in defaults conservative: include examples and disabled templates, but avoid baking in environment-specific secrets or required third-party services unless the project truly depends on them.

The default scaffold includes a ready-to-use Context7 MCP entry and commented examples for additional servers.

### Manifest

`.codexkit/manifest.json` tracks kit-managed files. It enables:

- `status` to report missing, modified, and outdated managed files
- `update` to refresh only safe targets
- preservation of local customizations unless overwrite is explicitly requested

## Design Principles

- Keep responsibilities separate: knowledge, process, execution, and work state should not be mixed casually.
- Prefer a small core that teams can extend, instead of a large catalog with overlapping instructions.
- Make risky behavior explicit and approval-gated.
- Keep Bead ownership explicit: the main thread assigns, workers execute, reviewer checks, and the user approves closure.
- Optimize for maintainability of the kit itself, not just first-run convenience.

## Extension Model

Projects can extend the starter by:

- adding new skills under `.agents/skills`
- adding new workflows under `.agents/workflows`
- adding new subagents under `.codex/agents`
- updating `AGENTS.md` to route new request types cleanly

The expected pattern is additive extension, not replacement of the core contract.
